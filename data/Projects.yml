- id: Yu-Gi-Oh! LOTD Link Evolution Card Finder
  link: https://cambuchi.github.io/LOTD-Link-Evolution-Card-Finder/
  desc: When I had Covid, during my 2 week quarantine and recovery I got into
    Yu-Gi-Oh through "Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution". Having not
    kept up with the franchise, finding out where cards were was a huge
    pain because over 10,000 cards were hidden behind character related
    booster packs & challenge duels. Other card finders did not have any
    visual aid or provide card information so they were useless to me
    because I had no idea who "Gong Strong" or "Akiza Izinski" etc were.
    This card finder utilizes the Yugipedia mediawiki API to grab images
    and extra information.
