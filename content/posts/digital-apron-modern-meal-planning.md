# I tried a meal kit service.

And there's a lot that I actually enjoyed. However, as someone who cooks at home extremely often, there were some big pitfalls as well. I wanted this experience in my cooking work flow at home, so I created **Digital Apron**, a meal planner that captures the intuitiveness and functionality of modern meal subscription services.

# The Pros and Cons of Meal Kits

## Pros:

* **The recipe cards:** the process of cooking was made incredibly simple with the recipe cards that these services provide. Simply grab a card and follow along for a smooth cooking experience.
* **No micromanaging ingredients:** cooking the recipes required no mental energy tasked to listing out the ingredients available to you. You can just simply cook knowing that everything you need is in your pantry already.
* **Decision anxiety:** when dinner time approaches, there's no more struggling with deciding whatâ€™s for dinner. Your meals are planned out and grabbing a recipe card is extremely straightforward.

## Cons:

* **Environmental impact:** I'm someone who brings their own bags to the grocery store. So it's extra painful to receive a box every week that's padded with foam, insulated, containing single use ice packs, and full of ingredients that are individually wrapped in plastic. Additionally, I imagine a lot more fuel is used up delivering those ingredients to my door than it would take for me to go to my grocery store nearby which is a 4 minute drive away.
* **Meals can hit or miss:** some of the meals provided ended up being duds. At times you can kind of see this coming just by looking at the recipe card, which resulted in a sad time in the kitchen as you prepare a meal you know is only going to be subpar. It was hard to get excited making those meals in particular.
* **Limited recipe catalog:** the recipes that are offered in these meal kits are overwhelmingly western. The deeper spectrum of spice, funk, and ferments are nowhere to be found.
* **Pricing:** a lot of money goes to the marketing and branding for these meal kits. While on promotion, they might be worth trying, but the normal pricing is much more expensive than getting groceries and cooking yourself. I've observed the price to be about equal to eating out, so the real decision is between cooking yourself and enjoying a restaurant experience.

* Servings adjustment when adding recipes to scale up or down.
