# Introduction

When it comes to building a blog/portfolio site, beginners are often directed to services like Wordpress or Squarespace. This is understandable, as these closed systems guide you through the entire creation process. Past this beginner plateau however, the difficulty in creating a fully customizable site with all the bells and whistles increases dramatically.

After reading this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/rlsxqk/if_i_was_going_to_create_my_own_blog_website_what/) on reddit I realized that even for people with web development experience, the lack of easily available instructions have many defaulting back to this beginner step as well. If you think more advanced web-content creation involves diving into code or crafting HTML for every post, then the editors on website building services would indeed seem very appealing. However I am here to tell you that this is not the case, and that similar tools and easy to use workflows are available for custom built sites as well.

This guide aims to create a guided "mid-tier" plateau that those beginning their web development journey can reference to help them move beyond standard website builders.

# Why?

1. Free
   * From beginning to end, this entire process is free. This blog you are looking at right now was made with these steps and did not cost me a single cent.


   * If you want your own custom domain then you would have to pay for that, but GitHub Pages is already set up to fully support custom domains.
